# Yokel
Local Yokel is meal kit service app, similar to Blue Apron and Hello Fresh, with a focus on locally sourced ingredients.
The app was made in two days as a minimum viable product for my team at Black Hills Startup Weekend 2016 in Spearfish, SD.
Originally, the app pulled all data from files on a webserver, but the server has since been shut down and data is now embeded in
the app.

By participating at a Startup Weekend and writing this app, I gained valuable experience in:
* Rapid UI prototyping and development
* Collaboration between developers, designers, and product owners
* Teamwork under a tight deadline
